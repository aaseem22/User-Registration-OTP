# User Registration with OTP Verification

This iOS app demonstrates a user registration system with OTP verification, following the **Clean Architecture** pattern using **MVVM**. The API requests are handled using **URLSession**, and the user interface is developed using **SwiftUI** with a modern design approach.

## Features
- User registration
- OTP generation and verification
- Clean Architecture with MVVM pattern
- Network requests handled using URLSession
- Modern and intuitive UI with SwiftUI

## Requirements
- Xcode 15 or later
- iOS 17 or later
- Swift 5.9 or later

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/aaseem22/User-Registration-OTP.git
   ```
2. Open the project in Xcode:
   ```sh
   cd User-Registration-OTP
   open UserRegistrationOTP.xcodeproj
   ```
3. Build and run the app on a simulator or a real device.

## How to Use
### 1. Register a User
